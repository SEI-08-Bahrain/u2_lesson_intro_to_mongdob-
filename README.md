# MongoDB

![MongoDB](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fcommunity.microstrategy.com%2Fservlet%2FrtaImage%3Feid%3Dka02R000000kcTI%26feoid%3D00N44000006DfHE%26refid%3D0EM440000002Jgk&f=1&nofb=1)

## Overview
In this lesson, we'll learn all about MongoDB, one of the most popular databases in the tech world.  We'll learn how to interact with *documents* in the mongo shell and why that's important.

## What's a Database?

Ever wondered why To-Dos in Express were lost when the server restarted? Databases solve this by persisting data. There are various types, and SQL and MongoDB are popular ones.

### MongoDB vs. SQL

#### Key Concepts

![MongoDB vs SQL Concepts](https://i.imgur.com/XdV3hSs.png)

#### Differences

**Use Cases:**
- **SQL Databases:** Ideal for mission-critical apps like banking. Strict schema and read limitations.
- **NoSQL (MongoDB):** Perfect for vast unstructured data like social media. Schema-less, adaptable, and scalable.

## More About MongoDB

MongoDB is part of the MEAN/MERN Stack, emphasizing JavaScript.  

MongoDB uses BSON (Binary JSON) instead of plain JSON for data storage. BSON is more efficient due to its binary format, resulting in faster operations and reduced storage space. It supports additional data types like Date and Binary, allowing MongoDB to handle diverse data more effectively. The binary nature of BSON contributes to better performance, making it a suitable choice for MongoDB's storage and retrieval requirements.

### MongoDB Documents

In MongoDB, data is saved and retrieved as documents in collections. Documents look like JavaScript objects (POJOs).

Example Document:
```js
{
    _id: ObjectId("5099803df3f4948bd2f98391"),
    name: { first: "Alan", last: "Turing" },
    birth: ISODate("1912-06-23T00:00:00Z"),
    death: ISODate("1954-06-07T00:00:00Z"),
    contribs: [ "Turing machine", "Turing test", "Turingery" ],
    views: 1250000
}
```

As you can see, this format looks very much like a JavaScript object.

### The Document `_id`

The _id is a unique identifier, similar to SQL's primary key. It's globally unique and created automatically.

### Before we Start

In this lesson, we are going to be working directly with MongoDB to create and read data using the MongoDB Shell in a Terminal window.

After this brief session working with the MongoDB Shell, you'll likely move on to using the Mongoose library for MongoDB interactions. Mongoose simplifies development by providing a structured schema definition, high-level models for CRUD operations, middleware support for custom logic, query building, data validation, and features like population for handling relationships. It streamlines the process, promotes good practices, and is widely adopted among developers working with Node.js and MongoDB. We'll delve into Mongoose in the upcoming lessons!

## Getting started
- Open up Terminal
- Windows Users Only: `sudo service mongodb start`

# MongoDB: The database for modern applications

*"MongoDB is a general purpose, document-based, distributed database built for modern application developers and for the cloud era ... MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, meaning fields can vary from document to document and data structure can be changed over time" - MongoDB*

### Used by millions of developers to power the world's most innovative products and services

## Let's Get Into the Shell

Run this command in your terminal:

```sh
mongosh "mongodb+srv://cluster0.bvo1sdn.mongodb.net/" --apiVersion 1 --username <username>
```

If you need to install mongosh, you can do so using brew by entering the following commands into your CLI:

```
brew tap mongodb/brew
brew install mongosh
```

Verify the installation by closing the terminal, reopening and typing:

```
mongosh --version
```

![shell](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.dribbble.com%2Fusers%2F39591%2Fscreenshots%2F553790%2Fshellloader.gif&f=1&nofb=1)

We are now interacting with the [mongo shell](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/mongo/). The mongo shell is an interactive JavaScript interface to MongoDB. We can use the mongo shell to perform CRUD (**C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate, **D**elete) operations as well as MongoDB administrative operations.

## Working with MongoDB

Once we're connected to a MongoDB server if we'd like to know what [database](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/glossary/#term-database) we're connected to we can issue the following command:

```sh
db
```
> `db` will return the current [database](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/glossary/#term-database) we're connected to.

To switch [databases](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/glossary/#term-database) we can issue the following command:

```sh
use <database>
```

> Note! You can switch to a non-existing [database](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/glossary/#term-database) and when you first store data in that [database](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/glossary/#term-database), the [database](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/glossary/#term-database) gets created.

To list all [databases](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/glossary/#term-database):

```sh
show dbs
```

## [MongoDB CRUD Operations](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/crud/)

We are going to learn how to perform all MongoDB CRUD operations using the mongo shell. Let's start by creating a users [database](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/glossary/#term-database):

```sh
use myUserDatabase
```

### [Insert a Single Document](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/insert-documents/)

Let's now create a new users [collection](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/glossary/#term-collection) and insert a new user!

```sh
db.users.insertOne( { name: "Benny", age: 28, status: "active" } )
```

- `db` represents our current [database](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/glossary/#term-database) (which in our case should be `myUserDatabase`)
- `users` is the new [collection](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/glossary/#term-collection) we created
> Remember: A [collection](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/glossary/#term-collection) is a grouping of MongoDB documents
- `{ name: "Benny", age: 28, status: "active" }` is the [document](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/glossary/#term-document)

We can also [insert many documents](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/db.collection.insertMany/#db.collection.insertMany) at once!

```sh
db.users.insertMany([
  { name: "Claire", age: 28, status: "active" },
  { name: "Joey", age: 28, status: "active" },
  { name: "Abe", age: 22, status: "pending" },
  { name: "Sunny", age: 23, status: "pending" },
  { name: "Lizzy", age: 28, status: "active" },
  { name: "Julie", age: 21, status: "active" }
])
```

### [Read Operations](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/crud/#read-operations)

Let's say we would like to retrieve the user [document](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/glossary/#term-document) that we just inserted into our users [collection](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/glossary/#term-collection). How do we do this?

```sh
db.users.find( { name: "Benny" } )
```

You can see we specify the constraint that we are looking for, so the constraint is: find all users in the users [collection](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/glossary/#term-collection) where name is "Benny". We can pass in additional constraints if we would like or we can remove all constraints if we'd like to see all users in the users [collection](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/glossary/#term-collection):

```sh
db.users.find( {} )
```

> Note: Once a [document](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/glossary/#term-document) is created in a Mongo database, [Mongo assigns each document a unique identifier](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/glossary/#term-id), hence the `_id` you see. The `_id` field is immutable.

What if we would like to only return user `names` and omit everything else e.g. `age`, `status`? We can do this with a [projection](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/db.collection.find/#find-projection). [Projection](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/db.collection.find/#find-projection) is the second argument in the query command below:

```sh
db.users.find( { age: 28 }, { name: 1 } )
```

> The above will return all users within the users [collection](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/glossary/#term-collection) in the myUserDatabase that have age 28 and will only return their name

or maybe we would like `name` and `age` but don't care for `status`:

```sh
db.users.find( { age: 28 }, { name: 1, age: 1 } )
```

### [Comparison Query Operators](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/query-comparison/#query-selectors-comparison)

We have a host of comparison query operators available for us to use:

![](https://i.imgur.com/EoYFpio.png)

```sh
db.users.find( { age: { $gt: 25 } } )
```

**Specify AND Conditions**

Find all users who have status of pending **and** age less than 25:

```sh
db.users.find( { status: "pending", age: { $lt: 25 } } )
```

**Specify OR Conditions**

Find all users with status of pending **or** age less than 25.

```sh
db.users.find( { $or: [ { status: "pending" }, { age: { $lt: 25 } } ] } )
```

### [Update a Single Document](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/update-documents/)

In order to update a document in a [collection](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/glossary/#term-collection) in MongoDB, we need to first find the [document](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/glossary/#term-document) we would like to update, then using the `$set` operator, we specify what field we would like to update and to what. And finally, we use the `$currentDate` operator to update the value of the `lastModified` field to the current date (if the `lastModified` field does not exist then one will be created).

```sh
db.users.updateOne( { name: "Benny" }, { $set: { name: "Ben", age: 29 }, $currentDate: { lastModified: true } } )
```

[**Update Multiple Documents**](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/db.collection.updateMany/#db.collection.updateMany)

```sh
db.users.updateMany( { "age": { $lt: 27 } }, { $set: { name: "Ben", age: 29 }, $currentDate: { lastModified: true } } )
```

[**Replace a Document**](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/db.collection.replaceOne/#db.collection.replaceOne)

You can replace an entire document. Just keep in mind the `_id` of a document is immutable - you cannot change it, however, you can change everything else.

```sh
db.users.replaceOne( { name: "Ben" }, { name: "Benny", age: 39, status: "active" } )
```

### [Delete a Document](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/remove-documents)

To delete one document that matches a condition:

```sh
db.users.deleteOne( { name: "Joey" } )
```

[**Delete All Documents that Match a Condition**](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/db.collection.deleteMany/#db.collection.deleteMany)

```sh
db.users.deleteMany( { status: "pending" } )
```

To delete all documents in a [collection](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/glossary/#term-collection):

```sh
db.users.deleteMany({})
```

## Recap
Wow, that was alot.  There are so many ways to interact with our MongoDB database by using the mongo shell, but it's not exactly easy is it?  In the upcoming lessons, we'll learn about tools we have that can make this interaction so much easier and more intuitive, but it's important to understand the basics and how our database is structured.  This will ensure we are performing our CRUD operations properly when we use these new tools going forward.
